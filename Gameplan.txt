SQUIDS

This is the plan from my perspective. I'm trying to list in order or priority but feel free to jump around & do things you find interesting.
Once a item is done, '*' that line to indicate the task is completed.

V.01:
    *Create core scenes & navigation
    *Create basic Gameplay elements:
        *Floor
        *Character
        *Enable keyboard control (left/right)
        *Enable Camera panning (Tracks the player. It is working but it is too high.)
    
    *Core player abilities
        *Jump
        *Shoot
        
        
    UI elements:
        Health meter
        Number of lives
        Items(?)
        Map(?)
        Etc

    Fix the camera. Why is everything so small?
    Allow user to shoot multi-directionally (currently can only shoot right)
    Fix jump parameters to fix the look & feel

        

For later:
    Implement Singleton model for universal game objects
    Level design
    Create Items
    Create Enemies
    Create Enemy AI 
    Character animations
    
    Additional player abilities:
        Grip special blocks regardless of gravity
        Flaming ink
        Bio-Luminescence
        Camoflauge
    
    Improve all graphics
    Add Sound effects
    Add music
